Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Spencer and this is my personal website built in Hugo.

I designed this site with legibility and a delightful reading experience at the forefront, and at the same time, tried to insert playful notes of personality throughout such as with the font/icon change to denote fictional works. 

I've also designed this site to be friendly to sharing and gaining traffic by ensuring unfurls and embeds grab the proper attributes as well as adding in Google Analytics.

This site is deployed via `deploy.sh` which builds the site and pushes it up to this (repository)[https://github.com/spencerc99/spencerchang.me], which is automatically deployed to "spencerchang.me" via Github Pages.
